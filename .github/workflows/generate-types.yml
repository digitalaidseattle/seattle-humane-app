# If you run into issues with this workflow, make sure
# that your Supabase CLI is up to date, then run
# `supabase stop --no-backup` - careful, this will delete all records in your local database
# `supabase db start` - This will apply the migration files
# `supabase gen types typescript --local > supabase/database.types.ts`
# that will create the database types for TypeScript.
